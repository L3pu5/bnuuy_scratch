# Bnuuy_Scratch

This is a simple project for my portfolio to demonstrate my ability to deploy a React/NodeJs frontend implementing a simple Rust->WASM lexer.

## React Front end

| Field         | Data          |
| --            | --            |
| Font          |  [Fira Code](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code?query=fira) |



## To do 
- [x] Write Lexer
- [x] Bridge to WASM
- [ ] Host simple interface
- [ ] Build React FrontEnd
- [ ] Allow JS interpretation of Token stream

## Live example
