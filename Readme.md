# Bnuuy_Scratch

This is a simple project for my portfolio to demonstrate my ability to deploy a React/NodeJs frontend implementing a simple Rust->WASM lexer.

## Lessons Learned for future users

1. When building from webpack build with the --target web and use the init() method to start the WASM VM.
2. When trying to render text and a cursor in a browser using a framework, it's probably easier and nicer to draw graphics using a canvas instead of trying to fiddle with drawing a cursor with css/html components and animating them with javascript.

## React Front end

| Field         | Data          |
| --            | --            |
| Font          |  [Fira Code](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code?query=fira) |




## To do 
- [x] Write Lexer
- [x] Bridge to WASM
- [ ] Host simple interface
- [ ] Build React FrontEnd
- [ ] Allow JS interpretation of Token stream

## Live example
- Currently undeployed
